Details
1. A web-deployed Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator is contained herein.
2. Website deployment accomplished with basic HTML and minor styling with CSS.
3. BMI Calculator itself is implemented with javascript.
4. BMI Calculator scripts are successfully tested using end-to-end (e2e) testing methods.
5. *A BMI Calculator is not an accurate measure of any one person's body fat percentage, and not even an accurate measure of general health.  It is simply a number correlated to the occurance of certain diseases such as heart disease.  Therefore, it is only **a relative, rather inaccurate guide.**  Personally, I would not recommend using this for any medical purpose.
