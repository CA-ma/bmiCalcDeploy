------------------------

Details
1. Website deployment accomplished with basic HTML and minor styling with CSS
2. BMI Calculator implemented with javascript
3. BMI Calculator scripts tested using end-to-end (e2e) testing methods.
4. *A BMI Calculator is not an accurate measure of any one person's body fat percentage, and not even an accurate measure of general health.  It is simply a number correlated to the occurance of certain diseases.  Therefore, it is only **a relative, inaccurate guide.** . Personally, I would not recommend using this for any medical purpose.
